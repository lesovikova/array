The task

Complete Deliverable

Create a JavaScript project (use jQuery and/or other frameworks if you wish) which loads an image and displays on a web page.

The image can then be assigned to an email address.

Your webpage should contain an input field that accepts an email address, which is validated.

On submission, the image is linked to the email address.

A new image will then display, which can be linked to another email address, or the same email address.

The interface is to display all images assigned to each email address, the email address should only display once.

The website is to be styled and professional looking, making it a good portfolio piece for potential employers.

The JavaScript should be in a separate file from the HTML and the solution should run entirely in the browser without the need to be hosted on a web server
