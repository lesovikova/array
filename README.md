# [Photos API project](https://lesovikova.github.io/array/)   
A very strange project for theNetmatters course. It uses external API to get random photos and allows the user to add them to different folders, I guess. Can't really think of a purpose to it, but it was fun to do JS. Though I've just discovered a bit of a bug. Oh, well.   
Uses HTML/CSS(Scss)/JS
